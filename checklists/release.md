Did all the examples build and run?

Did you run the commands `checklists/check_copyright` and `checklists/check_md`?

Did you make sure the LICENSE.md is the correct date?

Did you run:

```
docs/src/make_md.py docs/src/README.md > README.md
docs/src/make_md.py docs/src/docs/ProgrammersGuide.md > docs/ProgrammersGuide.md 
```
